# Talk-of-the-Tree-VR-project
Talk of the Tree is a poetic VR experience that transforms the user into a centuries-old oak tree deep in the forest. Created in May 2025 as a group project, I served as the game engineer.

ðŸ’» C# Scripting
Time-Based Scene Transitions: Control the experienceâ€™s pacing and emotional shifts through countdown-triggered environment changes.

Object Spawning System: Continuously generate different object types (e.g., nutrients, stones) at randomized positions.

Collision-Based Feedback (Nutrients & Stones): Trigger distinct visual and audio responses upon collision, such as color shifts, particle energy trails, or warning sounds.

Guided Nutrient Interaction System: Use color (e.g., red = harmful, blue = nutrient) and subtle narration cues to guide user decisions and interactions intuitively.
